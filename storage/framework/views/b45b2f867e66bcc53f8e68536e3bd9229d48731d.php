                                    Compare prices, experience and past work to get a sense of what will be best for you. Be sure to visit the pro’s Thumbtack profiles to see pictures of past work, reviews, and licensing information to help you make your choice.

                                    Thumbtack makes it easy to communicate with pros using our request forms and our secure messaging platform. Feel free to ask the pro as many questions as you need. It’s smart to inquire about similar projects the pro has done, references from past customers, if your project requires a permit, and if the pro plans to subcontract any of the work.

Verified reviews are reviews from customers who hired pros on Thumbtack, while Unverified reviews are from customers who found the pro somewhere else. You can also see how the pro responded to reviews to gauge how they treat their customers.

                                    It’s cliche, but true. Pros can provide photos or videos of their work to showcase their past projects. Look for examples of projects the pro has completed similar to your own. If you don’t see any, feel free to reach out and ask the pro to provide some.

                                    In the credentials section, you’ll see several indicators of the pro’s past experience on Thumbtack. Profile badges (bronze, silver, or gold) indicate how complete the pro’s profile is, and Best of Thumbtack badges indicates that the pro has been recognized based on their customer reviews during a certain year. You may also see a background check badge (meaning the pro passed a national background check) or a license badge (showing we’ve been able to verify the pro’s license through a public database).

                                    Send photos (or add them to your project details) if you’re looking for a distinct style, design, or technique. And you can always reach out to pros if you want to discuss the details over the phone. Once you’ve hired a pro, it’s also important to determine how payment will occur and what specific requirements you have for the project.

                                    <strong>Get a written contract.</strong>
                                    When you’re ready to hire, a written contract is the best way to make sure that you and the pro are in agreement, especially for very technical or high-value projects. For larger home improvement projects, many finalize the project and payment details in a contract. Smaller projects, like a one-time house cleaning or massage session, may require a different arrangement. The contract might include the who, what, where, when, and cost of the project. For lengthy projects, you may want to specify in the contract that payments will be made as certain work is completed.

                                    <strong>Keep copies of your records and payments.</strong>
                                    Create a record of communications, invoices, proof of payment, insurance, and proof of licensing. For construction-related projects, you may want to take photos of the ongoing work. Having photos and documents means that you’ll be prepared if there are unexpected issues. No matter what your project is, be sure to ask about additional fees beforehand and always make sure to get a receipt from the pro.
